Description
-----------------
This project contains one main program with many implemented classes. It can be run in 
python. In order to run it, there are several package which need to install such as Numpy and Pandas. dataImport will import the data and then store it inside on csv file. KNN is class for K-Nearest-Neighbor, Linear_Regression.py is class for linear regression and
polynomial_lienar_regression.py is the class for polynomial linear regression. main.py will preprocess the data and use the three models to simulate. main.py and dataImport.py
are the only two files suppose to be run.


To run main.py: python3 main.py
To run dataImport.py: python3 dataImport.py


Note
-----------------
overfitting---[need to be done]
